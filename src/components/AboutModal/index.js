                A Full Stack Web Developer with a background in oil and gas.  I earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University
                of Texas, where I learned new skills to compliment my previous experience with HTML5, CSS, Javascript and MySQL.

                  An innovative problem solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design. My experience 
                  in oil and gas has taught me how to adapt to a fast-paced work enviornment that is always changing and how to implement new information
                  as it is received. This experience has taught me to approach projects with creativity and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p className="">
              When I'm not creating or problem solving, I enjoy streaming and playing video games, outdoor activities, cooking and hanging out with my wife, 2 dogs and cat.
            </p>
            <p className="">
              I look forward to leveraging my skills as a part of a fast-paced, quality-driven
              team.  If you're looking for a fast learning, creative and critical thinking web
              developer to join your team, then look no further.
